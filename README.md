# FriendFinder

1. This is not my finest effort.

2. No styling applied beyond basic Bootstrap styling.  Ran out of time.

3. Did not figure out how to deploy the name and photo of the selected match on a modal.  The modal is functional but I did not get the desired information into it.

4. Information regarding the array of potential friends is simply presented in JSON format.

5. Best match is identified in the command terminal, for lack of a better way to do it.

6. Matching logic wound up in the htmlRoutes.js file rather than the apiRoutes.js file as desired in the homework instruction.
